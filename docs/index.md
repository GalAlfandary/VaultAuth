## Overview

The Mobile Seminar project consists of three main components:
- API Service: A backend service that handles authentication and user management
- Android Library (VaultAuth): A reusable authentication library for Android applications
- Example Application: A sample Android application demonstrating the library usage

## Components

### API Service
The API service provides authentication endpoints and user management functionality. It's built using modern web technologies and follows RESTful principles.

### Android Library (VaultAuth)
VaultAuth is a lightweight Android library that simplifies authentication integration in Android applications. It provides a clean API for handling user authentication, registration, and session management.

### Example Application
The example application demonstrates how to integrate and use the VaultAuth library in a real-world Android application. It includes features like:
- User registration
- Login functionality
- Session management
- Error handling
